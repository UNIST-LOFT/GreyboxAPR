# SimAPR
SimAPR is patch scheduling framework for patch searching problem.
It supports sequential algorithm from original APR tools, SeAPR, GenProg family algoritm and Casino.

## About this repository
This repository contains implementation of SimAPR, modified APR tools to generate all patch candidates and scripts to run them easily. 

Implementation of SimAPR is in [SimAPR](./SimAPR/). Detailed descriptions are also in this directory.

Our scripts are prepared in [experiments](./experiments/). Detailed descriptions include how to run the scripts are also in this directory.

We prepared 6 APR tools to run SimAPR: `TBar`, `Avatar`, `kPar` and `Fixminer` as template-based APR and `AlphaRepair` and `Recoder` as learning-based APR.


## Getting Started
This section describes how to run SimAPR.
If you want to reproduce our experiments, we already prepared scripts to reproduce our experiments easily.
Please see [Detailed Instruction](#detailed-instruction).

To run SimAPR, you should follow these steps:
1. Build docker image and create container
2. Generate patch spaces via running APR tools
3. Run SimAPR engine
4. Look inside the outputs
   
In this section, we will describe how to run SimAPR with TBar and Closure-62 benchmark.

### 1. Build docker image and create container
To build docker image, run the following command:
```
$ cd dockerfile
$ docker build -t simapr:1.2 -f D4J-1.2-Dockerfile .
```

After that, create container with the following command:
```
$ docker run -d --name simapr-1.2 -p 1001:22 simapr:1.2
```

Next, access to the container with the following command:
```
$ ssh -p 1001 root@localhost
```

### 2. Generate patch spaces via running APR tools
Before you run SimAPR, every patch space and patch candidates should be created. To do that, run the following command:
```
$ cd SimAPR/experiments/tbar
$ python3 tbar.py Closure_62
```

This will take about 2-3 minutes.

Generated patch space is stored in `~/SimAPR/TBar/d4j/Closure_62`.
Meta-information of patch space is stored in `~/SimAPR/TBar/d4j/Closure_62/switch-info.json`.

### 3. Run SimAPR engine
After generating patch space, run SimAPR. To do that, run the following command:
```
python3 ~/SimAPR/SimAPR/simapr.py -o ~/SimAPR/experiments/tbar/result/Closure_62-out -m <orig/casino/seapr/genprog> -k template -w ~/SimAPR/TBar/d4j/Closure_62 -t 180000 --use-simulation-mode ~/SimAPR/experiments/tbar/result/cache/Closure_62-cache.json -T 1200 -- python3 ~/SimAPR/SimAPR/script/d4j_run_test.py ~/SimAPR/TBar/buggy
```

SimAPR provides various scheduling algorithms: original, Casino, SeAPR and GenProg.
Original algorithm follows the sequence generated by the original APR tool.
Set `-m` option as proper scheduling algorithm.

This command sets overall timeout as 20 minutes.
If you want to set timeout for each patch candidate, set `-T` option in seconds.

### 4. Look inside the outputs


## Detailed Instruction


## Environments & Setup

### Environment
- Python >= 3.8
- JDK 1.8
- [Defects4j](https://github.com/rjust/defects4j) 1.2.0 or 2.0.0
- Maven

IMPORTANT: Defects4j should be installed in `/defects4j/` to use the scripts we already prepared. If you use Dockerfiles that we prepared, Defects4j is already installed in `/defects4j/`.

Original Defects4j v1.2.0 supports JDK 1.7, but we run at JDK 1.8.

### Preparing the patch space
SimAPR takes as input the patch space to explore and the patch-scheduling algorithm to use. Regarding the patch space, SimAPR currently provides an option to use the patch space of one of the following six program repair tools:

1. ```Tbar```
2. ```Avatar```
3. ```kPar```
4. ```Fixminer```
5. ```AlphaRepair```
6. ```Recoder```

To construct the patch space provided by one of the above tools, see the README file for the tool. For example, the README file of ```Tbar``` is available at [TBar/README.md](TBar/README.md). We also provide a Python script that automates patch-space preparation. See [experiments](./experiments/).

### Seting up SimAPR
SimAPR is implemented in Python3. SimAPR is in the [SimAPR](./SimAPR/) directory. To set up SimAPR, do the following:
```
$ cd SimAPR
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to reproduce our experiment
All reproduction scripts and their descriptions are available in the [experiments](./experiments/) directory.

## Running SimAPR
The implementation of SimAPR is available in the [SimAPR](./SimAPR) directory. To run SimAPR, do the following:
```
$ cd SimAPR
$ python3 simapr.py [options] -- {test_command}
```
More details are available in [Readme in SimAPR](./SimAPR/README.md) directory.

### Running SimAPR via Docker
To run SimAPR via Docker, install 
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Plus, you should install the following to utilize GPU for learning-based tools.
- [NVIDIA driver](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)
- [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)

Then, build the docker image
```
$ cd dockerfile
$ docker build -t simapr:<1.2/2.0> -f D4J-<1.2/2.0>-Dockerfile .
```

Next, create and run the docker container
```
$ docker run -d --name simapr-<1.2/2.0> -p 1001:22 [--gpus=all] simapr:<1.2/2.0>
```
Note that our container uses openssh-server. To use a container, openssh-client should be installed in host system.

`--gpus` option is required for learning-based tools. If you don't want to use GPU, remove `--gpus=all` option.

To use the container, do the following:
```
$ ssh -p 1001 root@localhost
```

## How to Add and Run a New Patch Scheduling Algorithm

With SimAPR, a new patch-scheduling algorithm can be easily added and evaluated as described in [SimAPR](./SimAPR/README.md).
