repair0 contains all the generated patches for five programs:
Math_95_jGenProg, Chart_15_jKali, Chart_26_jKali, Chart_13_Nopol and Math_50_HDRepair.
(See Table 3 in the paper.)

testcase0 contains all the overfitting-indicative test cases generated by DiffTGen
for two patches:
Chart_26_jKali and Chart_15_jKali.
(See Table 4 in the paper.)

We found the following 4 patches (the first found ones) are correct:
./repair0/Math_50_HDRepair/r0_log (r2_log)
./repair0/Math_50_HDRepair/r4_log
./repair0/Math_50_HDRepair/r5_log
